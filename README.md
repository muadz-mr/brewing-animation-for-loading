## Recreation and Animation of UI Design

Original UI design by Robert Bradford in YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9mhOBAbsuo).

After I finished watching the speed design video, I was thinking of recreating his design for the "Brewing.." modal part and making the coffee cup animated, like the cup is being filled with coffee.
